# Hello-bookish-Octo_World
My first introduction to GitHub
YO YO YO, what up my fellow peeps

Ren here and I'm working on switching from my wage stagnant career field in physical science,
to something a little more in my field of interest. Like Data Science, or maybe somewhere in
the future even software programming. All a general path to save me a bit of money to pursue
my actual goal of just working with my hands on something like building things from scratch.

Anyways. Here's to progress towards a brighter future with new found skills.
